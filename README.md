# Data Visualization Project: Outlier Detection in Univariate and Multivariate Signals

## Abstract

This project explores and detects outliers in univariate and multivariate signals across diverse datasets: catfish sales, Expedia dataset, and baby cry audio signals. By leveraging data visualization techniques and outlier detection algorithms, we aim to identify anomalies and provide insights into irregularities or unusual patterns. The methods include Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and KNN Outlier Detection, among others. Our findings contribute to understanding outlier detection in various domains, such as market analysis, online travel booking, and infant healthcare.

## Data Sources

### 1. Catfish Sales Data

- **Description**: Monthly sales data of catfish, suitable for time series analysis.
- **Preprocessing**: Imputation of missing values, outlier removal.

### 2. Expedia Dataset

- **Description**: Multivariate time series data related to online travel booking behaviors.
- **Preprocessing**: Selection of relevant features, imputation of missing values.

## Project Outline

1. **Exploratory Analysis and Outlier Detection in Catfish Sales**
   - Data loading, preprocessing, and visualization.
   - Application of various outlier detection techniques and analysis.

2. **Exploratory Analysis and Outlier Detection in Time Series Expedia Data**
   - Feature engineering, clustering, and outlier detection.
   - Insights into booking trends, seasonal variations, and user behaviors.

3. **Outlier Detection in Audio Analysis**
   - Focus on audio signals 
   - Use of FFT, PCA, and Isolation Forest for anomaly detection.

## Key Findings

- Identification of seasonal patterns and outliers in catfish sales.
- Insights into underlying patterns and anomalies in Expedia booking data.
- Effective outlier detection in baby cry signal.

## Future Work

- Exploration of advanced anomaly detection techniques and ensemble methods.
- Incorporation of additional features for enhanced anomaly detection.
- Predictive modeling for forecasting and improved decision-making.
